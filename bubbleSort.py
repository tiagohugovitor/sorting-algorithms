# Bubble Sort is a simple comparison-based sorting algorithm.
# It works by repeatedly stepping through the list to be sorted, comparing each pair
# of adjacent items and swapping them if they are in the wrong order. This process
# is repeated until the list is sorted.

# Time Complexity: o(nÂ²)
# Space Complexity: O(1), in place
